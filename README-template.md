## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

*Learnt how to make a responsive table
*Learnt how use the pseudo-selector ::marker
*Learnt how to make a page responsive without the use of media ueries
*How to use add my own font for css

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
ol li::marker, ul::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
@font-face {
    font-family: outfit;
    src: url(outfit-thin.ttf);
}
@font-face {
    font-family: youngserif;
    src: url(YoungSerif-Regular.ttf);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on:
*Table usage in web development. just want to know more about it and be perfect with it.
*Make more responsive web pages with no or less media ueries.

### Useful resources

- [@KevinPowell] on youtube - Helped me a lot in understanding responsiveness in css
- [stackoverflow.com] - Found useful answers to uestion on the websites. Just typr whatever uestion you
have on the browser and add stackoverflow to enable it bring solutions from stack overflow. Most issues on can have ave been answered there. And if it hasnt just ask your own uestion.
- [w3schools.com] - I learnt many basic HTML and CSS here. Went back to it multiple times I had issues.
